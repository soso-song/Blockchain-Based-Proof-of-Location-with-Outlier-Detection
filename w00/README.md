## CSCD92 Blockchain Oracle & Proof of Location

I'm interested in Blockchain Oracles and Proof of Location, which will have significant potential in many dApps. In this research course, I want to deeply understand each subject and write a paper related to them.



## Goal:

There are two goals I am interested in, and I am confident in a 12-week project since the plan for w1~w4 is applicable to approach both goals. In week 5, I will focus on one of them and create the last half of the plan and the reading list.

If the structure of oracles and proof of location could have many overlays:

- Can we create an oracle that uses a traditional Oracle structure while supporting location verification?

  > Current Oracles don't support location-related services.

Else:

- They(the current structure) tend to be more modular. Analyze the space and time complexity (a survey paper), then give a possible practice that reduces the gas price (paper with the invention if I find it)

  > Current location-related dApps generally will be used with Oracles.



## Plan

#### w1~w2: Read essential

1. Remarkable papers about Blockchain Oracle.
2. Remarkable papers about Proof of Location.

#### w3~w4: Read related

1. Prove of Coverage, whitepaper, and paper.
2. What is the difference with proof of location, and why are they chosen?

#### w5: Decide

1. Decide(Revaluate) which goal and write a detailed description.
2. Merge/summarize all notes/references made before (they could be used as components of the final paper).

#### w6: Statistics & Create Plan

1. Read more papers (new papers) and find some start-ups related to the goal.
2. Market research pain, gain, job. Write the first version of the abstract and introduction section.
3. Find a list of papers to read on the finalized goal and verify with the prof.

#### w7: Buffer for w1~w6

#### w8~w9: Make stuff!

1. I am working on the final paper.



## Reading List

### w1~w2: Read essential (Order matters)

#### [A study of blockchain oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.07140)

- 2020, Cited by 75, Oracle
- A paper has a lot of overlays with Chainlink's white paper. I want to read it briefly to familiarize myself with the paper's format.
- Notes: 
  1. "A concrete example of hardware oracle is implemented in Supply Chain." example?
  2. Human Oracles are losing it's power because chatGPT

#### [Understanding the blockchain oracle problem: A call for action](https://www.mdpi.com/874348)

- 2020, Cited by 73, Oracle

  > A recent systematic literature review on the subject showed that from a sample of 142 journal papers discussing blockchain real-world applications, only 15% considered the role of oracles, and less than 10% underlined the limitations of the oracle problem [23]

- Provides a list of "Oracle Problems"

#### [Astraea: A decentralized blockchain oracle](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8726819/)

- 2018, Cited by 167, Oracle

  > ...This has the potential to turn oracles into centralized points-of-failure. To address this concern, this paper introduces Astraea, a decentralized oracle based on a voting game that decides the truth or falsity of propositions. Players fall into two roles: voters and certifiers....

- A paper is trying to solve oracle's centralized points of failure.

#### [Trustworthy blockchain oracles: review, comparison, and open research challenges](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9086815/)

- 2020, Cited by 145, Oracle
- A extesion/implementation of the paper above: Astraea: A decentralized blockchain oracle

#### [Trust management in a blockchain based fog computing platform with trustless smart oracles](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167739X19301281)

- 2019, Cited by 132, Oracle

  > The DECENTER platform cannot rely solely on traditional trust systems, such as the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) hierarchical trust system or on a social trust system based on entity relationships. Practical implementations of trust management systems suitable for addressing various Edge-to-Cloud computing scenarios are currently missing, and this is the gap addressed by the present study.

#### w5+

I'll create the last half of the reading plan in week 6.
