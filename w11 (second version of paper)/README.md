## From last meeting:

#### Question (APPLAUS):

1. why does R_prov exists, what problem its solving?

   - APPLAUS didn't explain, but other paper explained nonce (n_user and n_AP):

     - Paper05 Proving Your Location Without Giving up Your Privacy (Cited87)

   - Problem sloved: 

     - Reason from paper 05: replay attack (by Witness)

       Every date generated after R_prov is dependes on it, therefore those M or Proof are not reusable.

     - Connection to this paper:

       > I believe they made mistake: server must has M, in order to check S_witt(M) by using P_witt. Because even instead store:
       >
       > - (pseudonym, location) 
       >
       > server actually only store following because they dont know M
       >
       > - (P_prov, R_prov, S_witt(M))
       > - (P_witt, R_prov, S_witt(M))
       >
       > lets say server returns location proof S_witt(M) (as it) to CA which forward it to Verifier
       >
       > 1. CA and Verifier also dont have ability to get/verify M
       >
       >    CA is not going to reveal pseudonym P_witt to verifier so verifier is unable to verify the time and location he receives S_witt(M)
       >
       >    Verifier not going to give location knowleage to CA so CA also unable to get M
       >
       > 2. the server level calculation will unable to use, paper will doesnt make sense
       >
       > For same reason prover also must has M so it knows the Proof already been encrypted actually describes the T and L witness proposed.

     - Summary (few edit on the paper): 

       Prover and Server must know M(at least Time and Location Witness is proposed) by the point it receive the Proof

     - (dishonest Witness, Prover)

       > consider Witness are students, Prover are prof, and R_prov = Assignment1

       - Each proof request is unique
       - Prover can confirm that the output of Witness is recent, not replayed from an earlier session. (Dont receive Proof if student submit A1 but Im receiving A2)

     - (Witness, dishonest Prover)

       > Consider Prover and Witness need generate a proof of consensus, so logically speaking both need to sign on this proof, but in our case, prover provides an random number, witness signed it.

       - Since the R_prov is signed by Witness in the Proof
       - When Proof generated, this random string acting like consensus between the prover and the witness.
       - Notice that we could dont use it, but prover need to sign something like time, then witness need to sign the prover's signed time. then the result is the same - both contrubuted some infomation to make a Proof
       - so there is no space for prover to dishonest here, he need forward the proof with correct R_prov to Server

     - (Server)

       - After Prover sends P_prov || R_prov || Proof send to Server through internet.
       - Server need to check if Proof generated by Witness also contains the same R_prov claimed by Prover, this process is checking if their consensus are match.

   - Extra Problem:

     > The paper did not explain the above question they just say "for verification purpose"
     >
     > So, our paper will likely explain that a little bit and also elaborate on the topic of **colluding attacks concerning R_prov** during process of uploading location.

2. why we using pseudonym?

   - Read folloing Global (Macro) Privacy

3. isn't bluetooth address already giving real identity out?

   - Read following Local (Micro) Privacy



#### User Real Identity in APPLAUS:

Global (Macro) Privacy:

- APPLAUS mention that 

  > the following data has time interval I will ignore here

  - Server store (pseudonym, location) 
    - only send hashed location to CA
  - CA store (pseudonym, real identity)
    - only forward hashed location to verifier
  - Verifier has <span style="color:red;">few</span> (real identity, claimed location)
    - require CA's feedback to validate
    - by sending CA real identity and time interval

- they define Definition1: the privacy information is separately distributed to the location proof server, the CA, and the verifier. Thus, each party only has partial knowledge.

- therefore if attacker wants to get all (real identity, location) pair in the network, they need to:

  - Only Option: hack Server, CA -> (real identity, location)

Local (Micro) Privacy:

- I assume prover just send his (real identity, location) to verifier so verifier can check

  > The verifier usually has close relationship with the prover, e.g., friends or colleagues, to be trusted enough to gain authorization.

- Definition 3 (pseudonym unlinkability) is not sloves issue that if nearby device recognize your bluetooth address and collecting the pseudonym you have

# Paper

<span style="color:red;">TODO</span>:

- I used bullet points a lot in the following paper to organize logic, but those will be combined into single lines in the future.

- As the latter sections of the paper become more detailed, the introduction may become outdated. Therefore, I will revisit and update the introduction with more accurate details at the end.

<span style="color:red;">Names</span>:

- DPoL:  Decentralized and infrastructure-independent Proof-of-Location
- BLIP: Blockchain-based Location Integrity and Provenance for Mobile Phones
- Leveraging Secret Network for a Decentralized and Infrastructure-Independent Proof-of-Location Scheme



## Introduction

##### Random Talk:

The increasing demand for location-based services (LBS) has prompted the development of more secure, reliable, and privacy-preserving methods for verifying the location integrity and provenance of mobile devices.

##### Problem:

<span style="color:red;">[Mention existing best approch (which is centrolized) implemention to make sure they know whats role Verifier and CA is playing]</span>

Traditional centralized verifier and Certificate Authority (CA) systems have inherent limitations, such as

1. dependence on trusted third parties, 
   - vulnerability to single points of failure, and potential privacy breaches. 
2. more

In recent years, blockchain technology has emerged as a promising alternative, offering a decentralized, <span style="color:red;">transparent</span>, and tamper-proof infrastructure for managing location data.

##### Solution:

In this paper, we propose a novel decentralized and infrastructure-independent proof-of-location (DPoL) scheme for mobile phones, leveraging the Secret Network blockchain and short-range communication technologies such as Bluetooth. 

- <span style="color:red;">We adapt their principles to the Secret Network blockchain, thereby eliminating the need for centralized verifiers and CAs. </span>
- Our approach builds upon existing research in 
  - APPLAUS: Toward Privacy Preserving and Collusion Resistance in a Location Proof Updating System by Zhu et al.
  - blockchain-based proof-of-location, such as the work by Amoretti et al.
  - CLIP: Continuous Location Integrity and Provenance for Mobile Phones by Lyu et al.
  - Practical implementations like 
    - Secret Network whitepaper
    - Helium whitepapers
    - FOAM whitepaper
    - A Study of Blockchain Oracles by Abdeljalil Beniiche
  - Furthermore, we consider the privacy aspects of commercial location-based services, taking into account Apple's Location Services Privacy Overview.

Our DPoL scheme employs the Secret Network's unique privacy-preserving smart contracts, called secret contracts, to store, process, and verify location proofs. These secret contracts enable secure, private, and auditable computations, which ensures user confidentiality while maintaining the transparency and security of a blockchain. By utilizing short-range communication technologies, our scheme allows mobile devices to establish secure connections with neighboring devices, exchange location proofs, and submit these proofs to the Secret Network for verification.

##### Layout:

The remainder of this paper is structured as follows: 

- Section II provides a comprehensive background on location-based services, centralized and decentralized approaches, and the Secret Network blockchain. 
- Section III presents the architecture and design of our proposed DPoL scheme, detailing the components, protocols, and algorithms involved. 
- Section IV evaluates the performance, security, and privacy aspects of our solution, comparing it to existing approaches. 
- Finally, Section V concludes the paper and discusses future research directions.

## The Location Proof System <span style="color:red;">or Prove of Location</span>

#### System Model: 

The system model includes the following types of parties involved:

- Users: Individuals act as nodes support short-range communication technology like bluetooth.
  - Prover requerst location proof
  - Witness helps generate proof
- Verifiers: Parties interested in verifying the location proof provided by users. These may include service providers, security agencies, or other users.
- <span style="color:red;">Model: Blockchain / Oracle, not keep mention Secret Network</span>: A decentralized network that facilitates secure and privacy-preserving transactions, storage, and verification of location proofs.

#### Location Uploading Structure:

>
> just intro the relation between parties, then mention different with Helium ...
> then add privacy using different way

##### Joining the Network: 

1. <span style="color:red;">Install the necessary software on the device. (I think we dont mention such details)</span>

2. Generate a unique identifier (public-private key pair) with the Blockchain <span style="color:red;">(start mention Secret Network in next section?)</span>. *using network connection*

3. Discover the network and its peers and the new node will start contributing to the Proof of Location now. *using bluetooth+network connection*

   Broadcast a *location proof request* to nearby nodes in the peer-to-peer Bluetooth mobile network.

   - Prover:
     - **Poisson distribution** as the rate at which location proofs are updated. By using this method, they can make it harder for people to figure out where you are by looking at the updates. 
     - **Periodically changed pseudonyms** are used by the mobile devices to protect source location privacy from each other, and from the untrusted location proof server.
   - Witness:
     - **User-centric location privacy model** in which individual users evaluate their location privacy levels and decide whether and when to accept the location proof requests.

   Tiers of approches (location proof request):

   1. Envelope of envelopes (Useful when checking stationary nodes)

      Since it does not involve blockchain calculations, the computation time is faster, making it worthwhile to explore this approach further. To make it work between non-stationary nodes, we could allow some layers of encryption to be decrypted by more than one node, depending on the signal strength (similar to a BFS tree where each directed edge represents a Bluetooth connection). 

      However, the issue is that the information obtained using this approach is the same as that in the next approach

   2. Uploading list of signed proof by both nodes

      For each nearby peer, send a signed location proof request. The peer will then sign this location proof request and upload it to the blockchain.

      However, the issue is that the information obtained using this approach is the same as that in the next approach.

   3. Uploading list of nearby public keys (Current Solution <span style="color:red;"> but I probobaly wrong since its different with other papers</span>)

      When discussing collusion attacks, one potential scenario involves sending location proof request requests through the network instead of using Bluetooth, In this case, false location proof request could still be signed & uploaded to the network. Therefore, the step of "signing" the location proof request might not provide significant security benefits on its own.

   Indeed, even when tiers 1 and 2 attempt to conduct some local verification before updating the location on the blockchain, they might not provide more information than tier 3. Consequently, the blockchain is required to determine which node is dishonest when validation takes place

##### Generation of Presence Claim: 

1. Presence claim request:
   - Prover public key, Verifier public key
   - Presence claim avaliable / expire time (when can verifier validate the Presence claim)
   - timestamp (where is prover yesterday)
   - granularity level
2. Private Smart Contract technology (e.g., Secret Network)
3. time-windowed presence claims & any granularity levels 

##### Verification of Presence Claim: 

1. Request the location proof from the Secret Network.

2. As we have defined a structure/scheme that collects user location data and a "decentralized" server to access the collected data and perform verification calculations, it is important to recognize that no distribution of speed and accuracy of verification calculations can satisfy all practical applications, particularly in the B2B domain. Fortunately, the scheme we have defined can directly utilize existing applications from centralized location proof systems or graph theory. 

   > For example, 
   >
   > some business can implement machine learning on the blockchain to decentralize the process of distinguishing cheating nodes within the network. 
   >
   > some can trust any location proof hence always generates presence claim if its meets their requirement
   >
   > some could just pick random node and consider it as cheating.

   In this paper, we will introduce an example of how to enable smart contracts to efficiently identify dishonest nodes on the network, incorporating elements of reputation systems that pervents colluding attacks.

   ##### Example:

   Paper13: **betweenness ranking-based** and correlation **clustering-based** approaches for outlier detection





> By combining the principles of APPLAUS, blockchain-based proof-of-location, and Secret Network, this decentralized infrastructure-independent proof-of-location scheme leverages a peer-to-peer Bluetooth mobile network to provide a secure, privacy-preserving, and efficient method for verifying location data without relying on fixed nodes. This scheme has applications in a variety of fields, including supply chain management, location-based services, and security applications.



## Other Works

Traditional PoL systems often rely on centralized verifiers or certificate authorities (CAs), which present a single point of failure and vulnerability to collusion attacks. To address these issues, there is a growing interest in leveraging blockchain technology to design decentralized PoL systems. Among different blockchain platforms, the Secret Network has emerged as a promising solution to provide privacy-preserving and collusion-resistant PoL systems.

##### Tiers of methods for location proof:

1. Normal LBS: Users upload their GPS location to a centralized server, but this approach cannot prevent hacks like those in Pokémon Go.

2. Traditional PoL: Relies on centralized verifiers and Certificate Authorities (CAs).

3. Existing Blockchain-based Proof of Location: Addresses some issues but still has privacy concerns related to user identity.

4. Blockchain + <span style="color:red;">Private Smart Contract technology (e.g., Secret Network)</span>: 

   > (privaty perserving blockchain)
   > Missing Peer to Peer part:
   >
   > - Make it sounds more like my approch sloves problem not just mention Secret Network

   - Resolves the issues mentioned above (centralized&privacy) (almost all papers)
   - Supports history location proof
   - Supports time-windowed presence claims. (paper 02, whitepaper 04/07)
   - Supports any granularity levels instead of harded coded integer number of levels and gereate 5 proofs when there is 5 granularity levels (paper05)

In summary, the four tiers of location proof methods progress from normal location-based services with centralized servers, through traditional PoL systems with centralized verifiers and CAs, to existing blockchain-based PoL solutions with lingering privacy issues. Finally, blockchain combined with private smart contract technology, such as Secret Network, provides a comprehensive solution that addresses privacy, security, and time-windowed presence claims.



## Other Topics

#### Test Cases:

1. Wormhole attack
   - Short-range communication technology hardware is capable of doing long-range.
2. Sybil attacks and Collusion attacks
3. Replay attack
4. Cheating on own geographic location

#### Privacy:

> The classic blockchain trilemma (Security/Decentralization/Speed) is insufficient when describing the web3 applications. I define the application tetralemma (Security/Decentralization/Speed+Privacy), which is more suitable to most recent web3 projects like Secret Network.

Nodes have complete control over the time and target they want to expose their Presence Claim. Secret Network powers this flexibility and privacy.
